Odin Project Assignments from 'A Bit of Computer Science' chapter

Project: Recursion
(https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion)

Assignment 1:
Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
Now write another function fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively.

Assignment 2:
Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
